This guide provides detailed instructions for cleaning up your computing environment on both Mac and Windows to ensure a fresh setup for RStudio. Using package managers like Homebrew for Mac and Chocolatey for Windows makes the process streamlined and consistent.

## For Mac Users (Using Homebrew)

### **Uninstall RStudio**
- Open Terminal.
- Use Homebrew to uninstall RStudio:
  ```bash
  brew uninstall --cask rstudio
  ```

### **Remove Configuration Files**
- Delete RStudio settings and session data:
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.rstudio-desktop
  ```
- Remove RStudio's saved application state:
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.rstudio.desktop.savedState
  rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/org.rstudio.RStudio.savedState
  ```
- Delete RStudio preferences:
  ```bash
  rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.rstudio.desktop.plist
  rm ~/Library/Preferences/org.rstudio.RStudio.plist
  ```

### **Optional: Clean R and R Packages**
- Uninstall R:
  ```bash

  ```
- Manually delete any installed R packages:
  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/Library/R
  rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
  ```

### **Empty Trash**

## For Windows Users (Using Chocolatey)

### **Uninstall RStudio**
- Open an administrative command prompt or PowerShell.
- Use Chocolatey to uninstall RStudio:
  ```powershell
  choco uninstall rstudio
  ```

### **Remove Configuration Files**

  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.RData"
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.RHistory"
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.Rprofile"
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\RStudio"
  ```
- Remove RStudio's desktop settings:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RStudio-Desktop"
  ```

### **Optional: Clean R and R Packages**

  ```powershell
  choco uninstall r.project
  ```
- Manually delete any installed R packages:
  ```powershell
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\R\win-library\4.x"  # Replace "4.x" with your R version
  ```

### **Empty Recycle Bin**

## General Maintenance Tips
- **Regular Updates:** Keep R, RStudio, and all packages up to date. Use `brew upgrade` on Mac and `choco upgrade all` on Windows.
- **Backup Important Files:** Regularly back up your scripts, data files, and configurations. Consider using cloud storage or external drives for backups.
- **Disk Cleanup:** Utilize built-in system tools for disk cleanup or third-party tools to clear temporary files and other system junk to maintain system performance.
