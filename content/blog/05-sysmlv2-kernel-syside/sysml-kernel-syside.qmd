SysMLv2 is rapidly establishing itself as the next-generation modeling language for systems engineering. One of the most convenient ways to explore the SysMLv2 Pilot Implementation is to use it interactively inside JupyterNotebooks or JupyterLab via the SysMLv2 Jupyter Kernel. This kernel allows you to execute SysML textual notation directly in notebook cells, run magic commands, query local repositories, and interact with the SysML API server.

This guide describes a reliable, working method to install the most recent SysMLv2 Jupyter Kernel on macOS, using:

 - [Homebrew](/content/blog/06-homebrew/homebrew.qmd)
 - Miniconda with conda-forge
 - [jenv](/content/blog/04-environment/environment.qmd#jenv) for Java version management
 - JupyterLab / Notebook
 
## What is a Kernel?

A kernel is a program that runs and interprets code in a specific programming language within an interactive computing environment, such as Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab. It acts as a bridge between the user interface and the underlying execution environment, allowing users to write and execute code in a particular language. Additionally, kernels can provide features like magic commands.

```SysML

%viz
```

## Prerequisites

### Install Homebrew

If you haven't already installed [Homebrew](/content/blog/06-homebrew/homebrew.qmd), you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Install git

If you haven't already installed git, you can do so using Homebrew. Git is used to clone the [SysML v2 Release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release) repository.

```bash
brew install git
```

### Install Miniconda

We use Miniconda as a lightweight package manager to manage our Python environment. Install Miniconda using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask miniconda
```

We now need to initialize conda for our shell (zsh in this case):

```bash
conda init zsh
```

Restart your terminal or run the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
exec $SHELL -l
```

Activate the base conda environment:

```bash
conda activate base
```

### Install jenv (Java Version Manager)

We use jenv to manage Java versions. Install jenv using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install jenv
```

## Install & Activate Java

The current SysMLv2 Kernel requires Java 21. The [SysML v2 Release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release) defines the required Java version as 21 under the [Install Section](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/blob/master/install/jupyter/README.pdf) 

### Install Java 21

Install Java 21 using homebrew:

```bash
brew install openjdk@21
```

### Add Java 21 to jenv

Add the installed Java version to jenv:

```bash
jenv add /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21 # <1>
```

1. Adjust the path if necessary, depending on your Homebrew installation location.

### Activate Java 21 globally

Set Java 21 as the global Java version:

```bash
jenv global 21
java -version
```

The expected output should indicate that Java 21 is active.

## Install JupyterLab

If JupyterLab is not already installed, you can install it using conda:

```bash
conda install jupyterlab notebook
```

## Install SysMLv2 Kernel

The installation process is defined by the [SysML v2 Release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release).

### Clone the SysML v2 Release Repository

Before installing the kernel, you need to clone the [SysML v2 Release repository](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release). This repository contains the Jupyter integration scripts, examples, and the SysML textual tooling.

First, navigate to your desired installation directory and clone the repository:

```bash
cd PATH        # <1>
git clone https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release
```

1. Replace `PATH` with your desired installation directory.

### Install the SysMLv2 Jupyter Kernel

Navigate to the Jupyter installation directory within the cloned repository and run the installation script:

```bash
cd SysML-v2-Release/install/jupyter
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Ensure Kernel Registration

Running the installation script places the SysMLv2 Jupyter kernel on your system, but it’s important to verify that Jupyter actually recognizes it. The kernel must be correctly registered so Jupyter knows how to launch the SysML engine, where the Java runtime is located, and which classpath to use.

```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

If the SysML kernel does not appear, or if you notice that the kernelspec path points to a stale directory (e.g., a conda cache), you can refresh the registration by reinstalling the Jupyter integration layer:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-sysml-kernel --force-reinstall
```
This step does not replace the SysML v2 kernel you cloned earlier. Instead, it ensures that Jupyter’s kernel registry is in a clean and consistent state so the SysML kernel starts reliably.

## Integrate SysMLv2 Kernel with VSCode (Syside)

:::{.callout-important}
The kernel can be used within JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebooks. However, I would recommend using VSCode with the [Syside Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sensmetry.syside-editor) for a more integrated SysMLv2 modeling experience. 
:::

To use the SysMLv2 Kernel within VSCode, ensure you have the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) installed. This extension allows you to run Jupyter notebooks directly in VSCode. The SysMLv2 Kernel should automatically appear as an option when you create or open a Jupyter notebook.
